# RocketNozzleDesign
This repository contains one of my apps to generate the rocket Nozzle. The calculation and principles of design were based on the reference books: (1) rocket propulsion elements by G.P. Sutton and O. Biblarz, (2) Physics of rockets, by Selfert, Mille, and Summerfield, and (3) Fundamental of rocket propulsion, by D.P. Mishra.  
  The aim of this effort is for benefiting the learning and practice of rocket design.  
  To apply and modify the code, you need to install a Qt on your local computer.
