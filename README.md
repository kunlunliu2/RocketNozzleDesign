# RocketNozzleDesign
This repository contains one of my apps to generate the rocket Nozzle. The calculation and principles of design were based on the reference books: (1) rocket propulsion elements by G.P. Sutton and O. Biblarz, (2) Physics of rockets, by Selfert, Mille, and Summerfield, and (3) Fundamental of rocket propulsion, by D.P. Mishra.
